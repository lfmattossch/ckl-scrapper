# ckl-scraper
It's a web scrapping tool that scrapes TechCrunch's blog in order to show my abilities to write code, comments and meaninfful git commits.

I used Djnago as the web framework and Scrapy to do the scraping. Besides that I found a cool DjangoItem in GitHub, in order to save normal Scrapy Items directly into the Django Model.
